# Alternative Schedulers
----

In addition to the built-in [docker-local scheduler](/advanced-usage/schedulers/docker-local), Dokku also supports two scheduler plugins:

- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-scheduler-kubernetes)
- [Nomad](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-scheduler-nomad)

These scheduler implementations may not be complete, though provide enough functionality for a user to get an app deployed via the underlying scheduler.

For users that require additional functionality, please refer to the [Sponsoring Documentation](https://github.com/dokku/.github/blob/master/SPONSORING.md).
