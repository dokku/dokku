# 0.23.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- The commands `proxy:enable`, `proxy:disable` and `proxy:build-config` now support the `--all` flag in addition to general parallelism.
- The `builder-cnb` plugin has been renamed `builder-pack`, and all related plugin triggers have had the suffix `-cnb` changed to `-pack`.

## Deprecations

- The 1.0.0 release of Dokku will no longer select buildpack builders over dockerfile builders if both builders match. Instead, Dokku will choose the first builder that responds to the `builder-detect` trigger. Users that wish to use a specific builder may set a builder using the `builder:set` command, which will force Dokku to use the specified builder regardless of what might be auto-detected.
- The `tags` plugin is deprecated in favor of the [`git:from-image`](/docs/deployment/methods/git.md#initializing-an-app-repository-from-a-docker-image) command. It will be removed in a future release, and is considered unmaintained. Users are highly encouraged to switch their workflows to `git:from-image`.
