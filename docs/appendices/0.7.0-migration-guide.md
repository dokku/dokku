# 0.7.0 Migration Guide

## Persistent Storage

We should now properly handle file ownership for mounted directories. This was enhanced in 0.7.1. See the [persistent storage documentation](/docs/advanced-usage/persistent-storage.md) for more details.

## Restart Policies

If you previously managed container restart policies via docker-options, these can now be managed natively via the built-in `ps` plugin. There is no migration necessary. See the [restart policy documentation](/docs/processes/process-management.md#restart-policies) for more details.

## SSH Keys

Dokku now has an `ssh-keys` plugin that can be used to manage ssh keys for the `dokku` user on the host operating system. See the [user management documentation](/docs/deployment/user-management.md) for more details.
