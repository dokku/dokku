# 0.8.0 Migration Guide

## Domain Management

You can now set global and app domains via `domains:set` and `domains:set-global`. See the [domains documentation](/configuration/domains/) for more details.

## Plugin Uninstallation

A new `uninstall` plugin trigger was introduced. This functionality may be in use for newer plugins, so be aware that older Dokku versions may require manual cleanup.

See the [uninstall trigger documentation](/development/plugin-triggers/#uninstall) for implementation instructions.

## Deployment Tasks

Should a pre or post deployment task fail, we now fail the entire deploy.

## Nginx HTTP2 Support

Due to bugs in Nginx, the minimum version for HTTP2 is now 1.11.5.
