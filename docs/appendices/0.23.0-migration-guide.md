# 0.23.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- The `plugin:list` command no longer outputs the version for the `plugn` binary.
- Users building docker images that run Dokku will need to use a new sudoer wrapper for the `docker-image-labeler` binary to work correctly. A reference version has been placed in the `docker` skeleton directory. This should only impact platform developers, and users of our Docker image will already have the file available.
- The `dokku` user's cron is now in use by Dokku itself. Customizations will be overwritten. Users are encouraged to use a cron file in `/etc/cron.d/dokku` to avoid this issue.
- As of 0.23.0, Dokku will now inject the `max-size` log driver option for applications. This is restricted to app-configured log driver values empty, `local` or `json-file` in 0.23.1 to increase setup compatibility. Users who configure alternative log drivers at the system level will need to either set the global `max-size` property to `unlimited` or switch to the built-in `vector` logging support.
