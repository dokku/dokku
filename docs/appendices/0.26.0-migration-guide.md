# 0.26.0 Migration Guide

## Removals

- The `tags` plugin - deprecated in [0.24.0](/docs/appendices/0.24.0-migration-guide.md) - was removed. Users are highly encouraged to switch their workflows to `git:from-image`.
- The `tar` plugin - deprecated in [0.24.0](/docs/appendices/0.24.0-migration-guide.md) - was removed. Users are highly encouraged to switch their workflows to `git:from-archive`.

## Changes

- The `scheduler` plugin now controls the scheduler in use for deploys. Apps will have their `DOKKU_SCHEDULER` environment variables migrated to the scheduler plugin, after which that value will be removed from said app. Please see the [scheduler documentation](/docs/deployment/schedulers/scheduler-management.md) for more information.
