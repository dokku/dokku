# 0.37.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- The path on disk to both the global `ENV` file and the `ENV` file for a given app has been moved. Users should reference environment variables via the provided plugin triggers rather than directly sourcing the ENV files. Existing ENV files are left untouched and will be removed on the subsequent Dokku install.
